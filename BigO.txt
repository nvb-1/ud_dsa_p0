Task0: O(1). Since we are only printing specific elements from a list

Task1: O(M+N). Since we are iterating through calls and texts list to determine unique ph no. I realized later that this can be performed using *set command, not sure if this would reduce the time 
complexity to O(1)

Task2: O(N^2). Since we have one for loop inside another.

Task3 - PartA: O(N) for the for loop. O(1) for identifying the unique set of elements and O(NLogN) for the sort.

Task3 - Part B: O(1) since the time complexity does not depend on the number of elements in the list

Task4: O(M+N+P) for the 3 for loops. O(NLogN) for sorting.
